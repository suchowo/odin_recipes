  <h2> Description </h2>
  <p> Egg cooked in a microwave.
  <p>
  <h2> Ingredients </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> An egg </li>
    <li> Some salt </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Steps </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> Spray microwave-safe container (e.g. mug, ramekin, or egg cooker) with cooking spray or wipe lightly with
      vegetable oil. Sprinkle a few grains of salt into bottom of container (salt attracts microwave energy and
      helps to cook egg evenly). </li>
    <li> Break one or two eggs into container. Pierce yolks and whites with fork four or five times to bottom of
      container (piercing is necessary to prevent "exploding" during cooking). If using a mug or ramekin, cover with
      plastic wrap, pulling back small area for venting. If using an egg cooker, place lid on cooker base, lining up
      notches. Twist to secure. </li>
    <li> Microwave on High (100% power) for 40 seconds. Let stand for 30 seconds before removing plastic wrap or
      lid. If still undercooked, turn egg over in container, cover, and microwave for another 10 seconds, or until
      cooked as desired. </li>
  </ol>
